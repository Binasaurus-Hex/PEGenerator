# PE Generator

small sample project that demonstrates how to write out a PE or .exe file from scratch
currently small selection of basic x64 instructions supported

In future, this may be cleaned up or incorpirated into future compiler projects, 
since I think compilers should be able to write out their own exectutables, without requiring large dependencies such as llvm or the ms linker
